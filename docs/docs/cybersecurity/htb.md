# Web Requests

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Today, the majority of the applications we use constantly interact with the internet, both web
and mobile applications. Most internet communications are made with web requests through
the HTTP protocol. HTTP is an application-level protocol used to access the World Wide
Web resources. The term hypertext stands for text containing links to other resources and
text that the readers can easily interpret.
